# Uber Price Prediction

================

**Predicting Taxi Fares for Uber Inc.**

This project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates fare prices for Uber's future transactions. As the world's largest taxi company, Uber serves millions of customers daily, generating vast amounts of data. Effective data management and analysis are crucial to inform business decisions and drive growth. A key challenge in this context is predicting fare prices with high accuracy, enabling Uber to optimize its services and improve customer satisfaction. This project seeks to address this challenge by leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to build a robust fare prediction model, ultimately enhancing Uber's operational efficiency and competitiveness.

## Introduction
------------

In this project, we are able to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** on the provided dataset, we performed feature engineering and find out the **KPI parameters** and some insights. After we experimented different regressor models and used the highest accuracy model which predicts the price accurately. If we are given with distance, passenger count and duration the model is able to predict the price efficiently. After that we created a dashboard for finding the filtered data based on the passenger count. In the other dashboard we showed different plots for start_date, end_date and payment-type. We used **streamlit** module for creating dashboards.

## Features
------------

From the dataset the key features are:

* Pickup_time and Drop_time
* Trip_distance
* Trip_duration
* Total_amount
* Passenger_count
* Payment_type
  
## Installation
----------------
You to need to download this folder in zip format. And to run the files you need to install 

    pip install streamlit
    pip install plotly
